# Discovering Exoplants using Machine Learning
> ML Logistic Regression

## Description

Using data on light level, we can discover the existence of exoplanets. We train data using what NASA has confirmed (koi_disposition) and 40 indicators 
Logistic Regression- Machine Learning classification algorithm that is used to predict the probability of a categorical dependant variable. 

### Prerequisites

Requirements of libraries 
- Scikit Learn

## Usage

With a high accuracy model, It will be simple to evaluate the existance of exo-planets with only datasets.
