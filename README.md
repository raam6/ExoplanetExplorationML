# ExoplanetExplorationML
Machine Learning algorithm to determine the existence of exo-planets from features.

- Logistic Regression- Machine Learning classification algorithm that is used to predict the probability of a categorical dependant variable.  

-Predict Variable (existance of exoplanet): 1 = Confirmed, 0 = False Positive
-Features are ranked, important features are kept while others are excluded. 
-Initial Model is improved with GridSearchCV
